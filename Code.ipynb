        "American Office Systems Inc., established in 1939, is a manufacturer of office equipment based in San Francisco. In the 1950s, when computers began to erode its market for bookkeeping machines, the company diversified and began to manufacture IBM and Macintosh adapters in order to tap-into the copy machine market. The goal of this case study is to optimize American Office Systems’ profit for the year 1996 in the face of many production, marketing, inventory, borrowing, and cash flow constraints. The findings of this study show that, in order to maximize profit, more IBM adapters should be produced and sold than Macintosh adapters. Furthermore, the company will not elect to borrow the any of the 750,000 dollars from the line-of-credit. Overall, the optimal solution will result in a profit of 13,031,411.85 dollars at the end of the fourth quarter of 1996.\n",

        "**Assumptions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our model relies on the following assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. American Office Systems, Inc. runs 2 work shifts of 8 hours every day for 20 days per month. Each quarter is made of 3 months therefore we made our full capacity the number of adapters for IBM and MAC produced each hour multiplied by the hours worked in a quarter. \n",
        "2. Forecasted sales are accurate \n",
        "3. We immediately pay the interest for borrowing in the previous quarter at the end of the following quarter and pay off all credit line from last quarter. Credit Line must all be paid for by Q4.\n",
        "4. Using a linear model is an appropriate approximation for an optimal strategy and further refinement will be done later. \n",
        "5. This model optimizes the accounting profit instead of the present and future cash flows of the operations. We opted for that sort of model because it depicts better the reality of the company and we found that, with the cash flow based models, the ending inventory of the last quarter was often too low to prepare for next year.\n",
        "6. The fixed costs of 3 million dollars are for the whole company and only a portion is attributable to the adapters. We decided that 250,000 would be a good starting point.\n",
        "7. The leftover Mac sales that are not paid for each quarter are also sold to collection agency at 50% of sales value three quarters after initial sale.\n",
        "8.Same 6% reinvestment rate applies for Q1-2 of 1997 and becomes their discount rate.\n",
        "9. Model should account for Q4 sales received in Q1-2 of 1997 and cash received from previous year's sales (1995 Q3 and Q4).\n",
        "10. Average inventories follow a linear model using beginning and end inventories by quarter and are used to estimate stock carrying costs and % was taken off variable cost of each type of adapter (as is usual in accounting).\n",
        "11.Temporal frame of reference for value of all cash flows is their PV at end of Q4 1996.\n",
        "12. Marketing spend is determined quarterly and is separated by product line (IBM and Mac) for optimal sales targeting of either product according to needs.\n",
        "13. Ending inventory/Minimum production calculation: for expected sales of Q1-3 used regular + Marketing sales instead of max base expected sales besides for the last quarter Q4 since it is explicitly mentioned to use max expected sales.\n",
        "14. Thus, the constraint for Q1-3 of “production plus the end-of-period inventory for the adapters should be at least 10% larger than the estimated sales for the next period” was taken literally as production Q1 + Ending inventory Q1 >= 1.1(regular sales Q2 + Marketing sales Q2).\n",
        "15. Carrying costs are assumed at the end of each quarter, none for 1997 since it does not pertains to next year’s activities just as beginning stock of 1996 included in 1996.\n",
        "16. Depreciation not factored in model since never paid for."

Since the maximum expected sales of IBM adapters in the fourth quarter of 1996 is 12000, the inventory level plus production of IBM adapters at the end of the fourth quarter of 1996 should be at least 24000, which is 2 multiplied by 12000.

        "**Cash Flow Constraints:** We included constraints to define our cash flows appropriately. The quarterly cash flow results from the sales of IBM and MAC adapters, which are calculated using the selling price, and keeping in mind the collection percentages per quarter. In addition, the production costs of both adapters are subtracted as well as the marketing costs for the extra adapters sold through marketing initiatives. Subtracted is then the holding cost where the inventory level is taken as the average inventory throughout that quarter. Subtracted again is the fixed cost per quarter. In terms of borrowing, the principal of the borrowing from the quarter before is payed back the next quarter with interest, and a new borrowing is made. This ensures that borrowing will never be above the $750,000 limit and leaves the flexibility for the company to vary their amount borrowed month to month as a line of credit acts as a pseudo chequing account. The borrowing payed back is not applicable for the initial cash flow, as there has been no costs associated with borrowing yet. Note that all net profit is then invested in government securities and the principal invested plus interest is received the following quarter, which is shown in the objective function. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Cash Flow First Two Quarters of 1997:** Collection is still being made in 1997 for adapters that are sold in 1996. Therefore, the incoming cash flows of 1997 include the collection. The borrowing from 1996 is also being paid back, which is subtract from this cash flow. All of the 1997 cash flows are discounted back 1/2 quarters using the interest rate of the government securities. Also note that in 1997, no new borrowing is made, only borrowings are paid back from the previous year. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Non-Negative Cash Flows:** These constraints limit the net profit with borrowing to be strictly positive.

Our assumption is that at the end of the period, all positive cash flow is invested in a government security. As a result, the cash flows ends up to be zero. The following period, the principal plus the interest is received and added to the new cash flow. This is iterative until the fourth quarter where the third cash flow principal and interest is received and is added to the fourth cash flow, plus the future cash flows of the first two quarters of 1997, discounted back. We are therefore trying to find the maximum of the fourth quarter, which combined all of the cash flows of the previous quarters as well as two first quarters of 1997, to maximize the profits of that year.

        "Production maximum capacities constraints are all based heavily on the work hours the company is able to operate with. Work hours are important since their maximum marketing sales are greatly limited to the amount by production capacity, as it influences last quarter’s ending inventory and current production. Three quarters (1,2,4) were able to reach maximum production capacities. This means the company is potentially losing extra marketing sales that enable them to offset further their fixed costs. Thus, losing any possible sales due to insufficient production to meet extra demand created by marketing is a concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since labour and associated costs are already included in the product variable costs, it is reasonable for the company to consider increasing work hours. Normally, if a company expects more sales in quarter four (Christmas period), they should produce more in quarter three and quarter four, and have longer operating hours in the factory. As long as machines are able to tolerate greater usage, all-day operations (22-24 hours) can also be considered, but this leaves more risk with less time for maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, since the company currently has two shifts daily of 8 hours (16 hours daily operating hours), increasing both work shifts to **10 hours for every quarter (20 daily operating hours a day)** is realistic in this 1990s work environment and reasonable enough to allow time for machine maintenance. Less than 8 hours is unrealistic, which is why settling for 10 hours is the most feasible if the company needs the same hours for each quarter. Decreasing would only lessen the company's profits.\n",

        "A linear optimization model was performed to maximize the profit of American Office Systems for the year of 1996. Our model took into account numerous constraints, which represented the many barriers that the company encountered while trying to maximize their profit. While analyzing the company, we noticed some factors that could have limited the profit of American Office Systems, and we suggest these factors be improved in order to reach a higher profit. First, there were serval limiting inventory constraints, which were designed to either provide a smooth transition to the year 1997, or to provide a safety cushion to help prevent shortages. We found these constraints to be very conservative, but we nevertheless recognize their importance. Therefore, we suggest making these constraints more aggressive by proving less of a smooth transition to 1997, or to provide less of a safety cushion, in hopes of ultimately increasing profit. Furthermore, we recommend that the left-over cash in each quarter not be reinvested in government securities. Although these securities will generate cash flow overtime, reinvesting left over cash back into the company could be more profitable. This would allow the left-over cash to be invested in research and development for example, to perhaps increase the maximum number of adapters that are able to be produced every hour, and improve other similar factors that are limiting profit.
